# Getting Started Guide

Welcome to the Task Management Dashboard with Deployment Tracking! This guide will help you get up and running quickly.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- **Node.js** (version 16 or higher)
- **npm** (comes with Node.js)
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge)

## Quick Start

### 1. Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd task_management_dashboard_with_deployment_tracking_y8mrqb

npm run dev
```

### 2. First Launch

Once the development server starts:
1. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173`

## Initial Setup

### Understanding the Interface

The application consists of five main sections:

## Deployment Tracking

### Understanding Environments

The system tracks deployments across three environments:
- **Development**: Initial development and testing
- **Staging**: Pre-production testing
- **Production**: Live environment

### Tracking Deployments

1. Navigate to the **Deployments** section
2. View the deployment pipeline for each task
3. Monitor deployment status and approvals
4. Add notes and comments for each deployment
5. Link to pull requests and demo videos

## Data Persistence

### Local Storage

The application uses client-side storage:
- All data is stored locally in your browser
- Data persists between sessions
- No external database required

### Backup and Restore

To backup your data:
1. The database is automatically saved to localStorage
2. You can export data through the browser's developer tools
3. To reset: Clear browser data or use the "Clear Database" option (if available)

## Customization

### Themes and Styling

The application uses Tailwind CSS for styling:
- Modify `tailwind.config.js` for custom colors
- Update component styles in individual files
- The design is fully responsive

### Adding Features

To extend functionality:
1. Add new components in the `src/components/` directory
2. Update the database schema in `src/services/database.ts`
3. Modify the main navigation in `src/App.tsx`

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Application won't start:**
- Ensure Node.js is installed correctly
- Delete `node_modules` and run `npm install` again
- Check for port conflicts (default: 5173)

**Data not persisting:**
- Check browser localStorage settings
- Ensure cookies and local storage are enabled
- Try a different browser

**Performance issues:**
- Clear browser cache
- Check for browser extensions that might interfere
- Ensure you're using a modern browser

### Getting Help

- Check the documentation in the `docs/` folder
- Review the component source code for implementation details
- Open an issue in the project repository

## Next Steps

Now that you're set up:
1. Explore each section of the application
2. Create your own tasks and team members
3. Customize the interface to match your workflow
4. Review the API documentation for advanced usage
5. Consider contributing to the project
